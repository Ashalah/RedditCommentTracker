RedditCommentTracker
====================

Chrome extension that remembers and highlights which comments you've seen in a Reddit thread. Click a comment to set is as viewed.

It is useful for when you make a thread in which you want to read ALL the comments, including those of people replying to other people than yourself.

Very simple, lacking in features, but gets the job done.

There is no way to turn it off, just disable the extension when you're not using it.
